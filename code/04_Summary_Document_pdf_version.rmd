# Goals for project

Calculate percentage of students whose **STAAR reading scores** are:  

* Approaching grade level
    * Overall
    * By school type (Elementary, middle, high school)
    * By gender
    * By race
* Meets grade level
    * Overall
    * By school type (E, M, S)
    * By gender
    * By race
* Create at least one graph    


## Summary of Wrangling

I recoded negative values (-1 and -3) as well as "." as NA, since I assumed these were missing or otherwise incorrect data. I excluded gradetype == "B", as I was unsure what it was in relation to. The main issue with the data was it was in a non-tidy wide format, so I  `gathered` the data to convert to tall format. I then extracted out the various codes for race, group, gender, and gradetype as individual factors rather than a single combined factor. I also labeled these factors with more descriptive (eg CB00 = African American student). I `filtered` to only include Reading performance, and then `joined` the data back together into either meeting or approaching datasets. I converted all the student values (numerator, denominator, rate) to numbers and checked to make sure that Rate was equivalent to percentage. I then saved both an Excel and RDS output of the clean data for storage or use in summary calculations/graphing.

```{r, echo = F, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
library(here)
```
```{r, echo = F}
table_df <- readRDS(here("/output_data/STAAR_16_17_reading_summary_tables.RDS"))
table_group <- table_df$group
table_race <- table_df$race
```
## Summary Tables

I focused on splitting the data into race and groups (gender, special categories). I am presenting them here as those two tables but I also saved an additional table with ALL the data combined.

```{r, echo = F}
table_group %>% 
    kable(., "latex", caption = "STAAR Reading level by Group, Grade-type, and Year") %>% 
    kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down"))
```

```{r, echo = F}
table_race %>% 
    kable(., "latex", caption = "STAAR Reading level by Race, Grade-type, and Year") %>% 
    kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down"))
```

## Graphs

I wanted to focus on examining the data by race, and specifically for the 4 most common groups (African american, asian, hispanic, and white). I plotted two graphs, one for meeting reading standards and one for approaching reading standards.

&nbsp;

```{r approaching, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Fig. 1 2016-17 STAAR Reading performance approaching grade level standards by race", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("/plots/approaching_gap.png"))
```

```{r meeting, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Fig. 2 2016-17 STAAR Reading performance meeting grade level standards by race", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("/plots/meeting_gap.png"))
```

## One thing I learned

I really haven't had to do that many summary tables for my PhD, as we typically graph everything. So I wanted to end up with nice looking tables in a .rmd report as something to learn. I focused on the `kableExtra` package which is intended to create beautiful tables quickly and painlessly. I also appreciate the fact that there was a consistent coding scheme for the data, and although it is not how data is typically arranged in my world, it was done consistently and clearly!

Additionally, at the beginning of the assignment I spent a lot of time digging through the coding system to make sure I understood how to break it up and not have to hardcode all the various combinations of groups/races/subject/year. I'm really pleased with the pseudo-database I formed that has the various groups assigned, as it saved me a lot of coding.

## How did I fill gap?

I really spent longer than expected making sure I understood some of the ways I would need to alter the raw data to appear nice in a table, so I dug through the documentation for `kableExtra` on GitHub as seen [here](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_html.html). I wanted to end up with a useful, clean, and attractive table, and this made it a lot easier. This required me renaming some of the variables so they had nice descriptive titles rather than simple snake-case titles.

## 60-90 Min adequate?

I definitely went over in time, I could have completed the assignment inside 90 minutes, but I spent an extra hour at the beginning planning out HOW I wanted to start the project, what I wanted to achieve and the most efficient way to do that. I also spent some extra time going back through the assignment and really making sure I felt comfortable passing it off to a colleague for them to understand what I was trying to do. All in it took me probably 2.5 hours to get through everything, not including time to read through the `kableExtra` documentation further.


I really enjoyed working through this project, and I like that y'all provided take-home assignments!
